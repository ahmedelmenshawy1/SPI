The interconnection between Master and Slave CPUs with SPI is shown in Figure 66. The system
consists of two Shift Registers, and a Master clock generator. The SPI Master initiates the
communication cycle when pulling low the Slave Select SS pin of the desired Slave. Master and
Slave prepare the data to be sent in their respective Shift Registers, and the Master generates
the required clock pulses on the SCK line to interchange data. Data is always shifted from Master
to Slave on the Master Out – Slave In, MOSI, line, and from Slave to Master on the Master In
– Slave Out, MISO, line. After each data packet, the Master will synchronize the Slave by pulling
high the Slave Select, SS, line.
